This folder contains a complete example to convert PROTEIN-MEM-WAT system from GROMACS to ddcMD

1. run1-para.sh

use martini2obj to convert the GROMACS itp files to ddcMD paramter files: martini.data molecule.data ConsAtom.data
all the GROMACS itp files and associated input files are in the para directory.
Note that: The “[ position_restraints ]” section in itp files has been removed because the ITP parser cannot parse it correctly. 


2. run2-coor.sh

use pdbmartini2obj to convert PDB file and top file in the gromacs directory to the ddcMD coordinates files: atoms#000000 and the restart files.
use restraint to generate the restraint.data (for POPX) require in ddcMD calculation.
organize the ddcMD files so it can be use for ddcMD simulation.

3. run3-ddcmd.sh
run the ddcMD simulation. 

Make sure the following inputs are presented:

martini.data 

object.data molecule.data 

restraint.data 

restart - symbolic link file

snapshot.mem
    atoms#000000  
    restart
