;;;;;; HYDRATED CALCIUM ION
;
; Warning: this is untested, and likely not very realistic description of
; a calcium ion. For a proper description of calcium, the solvation free
; energy should be increased. This could be achieved in an ad-hoc manner
; through increasing of the LJ well depth for water-calcium interactions.
